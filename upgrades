Next evolution tiers (when you want to go nuclear):

Keycard / QR issuance

Audit logs per staff member

Manager override + undo window

Revenue attribution per shift

You didn’t just “add features”.
You hardened a system.


We can:

Add alert counts + badges

Auto-refresh every 30s (or use revalidation)

Click alert → deep-link to booking / suite

Add STAFF acknowledgment (“Mark as resolved”)

Introduce alert severity levels

This system is officially no longer a dashboard — it’s an operations nerve center.
