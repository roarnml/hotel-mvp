If we build **this structure in the dashboard**, we can later add **feature toggles per role** in a few lines of code.

Next, we can **design the database models for users, roles, and permissions** so all of this is enforceable in Prisma and the dashboard.

Do you want me to map the **Prisma models for Super User / Admin / Staff** next?
